# Final Project
**CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science**

## StockX
StockX is a app designed for new investors navigating the Brazilian stock market (B3) who follow a strategy of maintaining an even distribution of their holdings across multiple stocks. This app provides a interface to simulate the purchase of new shares, allowing investors to visualize the impact on their portfolio before making any real investments.
## Key features
1. **Portfolio Overview:**
    - View a overview of your current portfolio, including the number of shares, the total value of each stock and the weight they represent in your portfolio.
2. **Simulate New Share Purchase:**
    - Easily simulate the purchase of new shares and the impact in your portfolio.
3. **Real-Time Prices:**
    - Access updated stock prices from the B3 market, powered by the finances API Brapi available on https://brapi.dev/. This integration ensures accurate data based on the latest market conditions.

The objective is to assist new B3 investors in enhancing their decision-making regarding portfolio allocation, optimizing investments, maintaining a well-balanced distribution across all holdings, and visualizing their overall investment strategy.

## Files content
 - `static/index.js`: File that contains the javascript responsible for updating the table when the number of shares changes:
    - `handleSharesNumber` function: Handle the value of the shares input, performs validations to avoid invalid values, calculates new value, assigns the value to the element and returns the new value.
    - `updateTable` function: Calls the handleSharesNumber function and based on the returned value, calculates and updates the table with new values, it is called when the increment and decrement buttons are clicked.
 - `schema.sql`: SQL code that creates the database file and tables.
 - `app.py`: Main app file, for general configuration and routes.
 - `helpers.py`: Functions that will be used several times in the project:
    - `login_required` function: Check if there is already an active session and redirects to the login page.
    - `quote` function: Make a request to the Brapi API to obtain data for a specific symbol.
